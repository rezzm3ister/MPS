WELCOME TO THE NEW AECES MERIT POINT SYSTEM

HOW TO USE:
step 0: preparing the data

have member list as a 2 column csv named 'members.csv'
column 0: id number
column 1: points
example in exmem.csv

from the reg/ct/volunteer spreadsheets (event reg etc):
copypaste the ID NUMBERS ONLY onto a blank .csv file and name it accordingly.
example in exreg.csv

EACH FILE MUST BE NAMED CORRECTLY:
eventgoers id list: "eventreg.csv"
core team id list: "ctlist.csv"
volunteers id list: "volunteers.csv"
performers: "performers.csv"

MAKE SURE THE FILES YOU WANT TO USE ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE PYTHON SCRIPTS


step 1: adding points
there are different add options for each group of people:
event registration list (eventgoers) (+10pts)
core team members (+20)
volunteers (+10 or +15 depending on event scale)
event performers (+15) 

each of these use their own csv files so that you dont give the wrong group of people the wrong number of pts

note: some other bonus points have too few recipients at a time so its better to manually do that.
	examples: promos, writeups/docu, project head

for double points due to event success just run core team twice lmao


MISC:
But what about google drive? just download and/or upload the members.csv file when you need to update it.
it has to be like this because python but hey you dont have to manually change each and every value yourself 

made a mistake? delete or rename members.csv and take out the newest file in the autogenerated backups folder.
then rename that backup to just members.csv and then relaunch the script and go again.
